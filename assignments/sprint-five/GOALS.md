## Goals
While I do not have a concrete idea for what I want my application to do yet, I am considering building a web app that has users sign in using Spotify as the SSO provider. Once signed in, the app will use an access token granted by Spotify to access the user's account information, listening history, playlists, and folowing list and display this data for the user to see. The core audience for this application would be individuals looking to gain insight to their music preferences. I think it would also be cool to display some analysis of the user's data, such as recommended artists and playlists, however this idea might be too involved to include in the application at this time.
