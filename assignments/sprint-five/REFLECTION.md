SSO is a difficult set of concepts to grasp. Describe what worked, and what did not. Provide a list of sites you visited in your quest 
to understand and get your app going. If your app did not work (for SSO to Google OAUTH or other provider you selected), explain where 
you got stuck. Finally, briefly describe what you hope to have functioning with SSO, in terms of "your app", by the end of the semester.
