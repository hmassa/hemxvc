## Reflection
Most of the challenges I faced while completing this assignment had to do with finding the Windows commands that are equivalent to the ones in the assignment steps. While most of these commands had an exact Windows counterpart, the "make" command required for the Dex example does not. On Stack Overflow I read that Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows, provides a solution to this issue. So, after installing this software I was able to get the Dex example working. Apart from that, I luckily did not have any significant issues with Google OAUTH or anything else. 
While I am not yet sure what exactly I want to do with my app, I think it would be cool to have multiple OAuth providers-for example GitHub, Twitter, Google, etc.-so that users can select which of their accounts they would like to use for SSO. I would also like to learn more about how SSO can replace cookies as I don't totally understand that yet, but I think it is a very interesting and modern idea that I could potentially use in my app.
