# Discussion Summary

This video followed CHAOSS's Evolution working group as members reviewed recent pull requests. The first topic of discussion in
this video surrounds adding two new filters to the "Reviews" metric that would combine several related metrics into one. Next, 
the group reviews a pull request for a new metric called inactive-contributors. This metric counts the number of past contributors
that have not made a contribution in a particular time interval. During this discussion adjustments were made to the metric 
definition template as there was some uncertainty about what all a metric definition should have. At the end of the video,
another pull request for a new metric called code_changes_lines was briefly discussed.
