My web application implementing the single sign on project I selected can be found at: 
http://ec2-3-134-97-105.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

This link will take you to a page where you can select how you would like to sign in to the application (currently, 
GitHub is the only option). The login button then redirects users to to the selected party's login portal. Once the 
correct credentials have been entered, users are redirected to the homepage of my website.
