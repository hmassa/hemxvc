# Licenses
Based on my very, very limited understanding of legal language, I think the license I would prefer to use for an open 
source project I create would be the GNU General Public License version 2. I liked this license because it ensures that the
software covered by this license can be shared and modified, but it must be free to all users. Also, this license 
states that you cannot be forced to give up these rights and that everyone you share the software/source code with also has 
these rights. Furthermore, this license protects contributors from being held liable for any damages incurred by using the 
software. From what I understand, this license best protects the integrity of the open source community by ensuring that software
covered by this licenese is available to the public, free of charge, and can be modified but cannot be included in proprietary 
software.  
The license I would least want to use is the Apache 2.0 License. I think this license gives too much freedom to the recipients of
the work as they are given the irrevocable right to sell the software. I personally believe that open source software should not 
be able to be taken by another organization and sold for a fee as this takes advantage of the open source concept.
