# Podcast reflections
I like that pretty much everyone who talked emphasized that you don't have to have a PhD to make a valuable addition 
to an open source project and that people from all backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate. I think 
one of the most daunting aspects of contributing to an open source project is the fear that you don't know enough about 
it to really make a useful contribution, so I admire how welcoming and encouraging all of the speakers were.
